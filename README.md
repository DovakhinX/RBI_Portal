Decentralized KYC Verification Process for Banks-RBI portal 

Central Bank and other government banks face issues in 
tracking money laundering activities that are used for 
terrorism and other crimes. It is a threat to national 
security and is also adversely affecting the economy.
KYC (Know Your Customer) is a service provided by 
financial institutions such as banks. There are both 
public and private sector banks managed by a central 
bank. These banks are banned by the central bank from 
adding any new customer and do any more customer KYCs 
as they see suspicious activities that need to be 
sorted out first. Despite this, the banks add new 
customers and do the KYC in the background.
An immutable solution is needed where the central bank 
maintains a list of all the banks and tracks which 
banks are allowed to add new customers and perform KYC. 
It can also track which customer KYC is completed or 
pending along with customer details.
Banks can also add the new customer if allowed and do 
the KYC of the customers
